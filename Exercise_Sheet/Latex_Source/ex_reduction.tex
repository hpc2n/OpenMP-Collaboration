\subsection{Exercise: Reduction}
\subsubsection{Revised ``Calculating Pi" code}~\label{piReductionExercise}
Copy your parallel code from exercises~\ref{calcPiAtomicExercise}.  
Upgrade the copies to use loop construct and a reduction operation.  Make sure your code is neat and tidy.  The code should compile serially and parallel.

\subsubsection{Working for any number of iterations and any number of threads}
Show that the code in exercise~\ref{piReductionExercise} give correct answers, within rounding, even even if the iteration count and the number of threads do not divide.  You will not get this for the version in exercises~\ref{calcPiAtomicExercise}.  This is easiest when you use a moderate iteration count and compare for different numbers of threads.

\subsubsection{Revised triangular sumation code}
Copy your parallel code from the exercise~\ref{triangularSumExercise}. Upgrade the copies to use loop construct and a reduction operation.  Make sure your code is neat and tidy.  The code should compile serially and parallel.
