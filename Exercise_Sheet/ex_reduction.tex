\subsection{Exercise: Reduction}
\subsubsection{Revised ``Calculating Pi" code}
Copy your parallel code from exercises \ref{calcPiAtomicExercise}.  
Upgrade the copies to use loop construct and a reduction operation.  Make sure your code is neat and tidy.  The code should compile serially and parallel.

\subsubsection{Revised triangular sumation code}

\ref{triangularSumExercise}
\subsubsection{Working for any number of iterations}
Show that the code gives, within rounding, correct answers even even if the iteration count and the number of threads do not divide, while you old versions are incorrect.  This is easiest when you use a moderate iteration count and compare for different numbers of threads.
